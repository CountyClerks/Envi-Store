## Short Description
A mock shoopping website to buy artwork online built from React using React Router to seamlessly handle page re-direction. Artwork is displayed on the home page through an array of objects that are passed as props into the home page. Artwork can be sent to the shopping cart page through clicking on the "buy" button after hovering over an artwork card. The shopping page will list all of the chosen artwork and the total cost.

## Demo

## Credit and License
The theme and layout of the home page was based on a Figma design made by @riaarante. The Figma file can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/947671983918628823). The shopping cart and artists page designs were created by me through the inspiration of the Figma file's color palette.
